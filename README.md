Wine Quality Prediction and Clustering

In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of wines, leveraging a supervised learning approach to predict wine quality from various physicochemical features. Using a dataset that encapsulates attributes like acidity, sugar level, alcohol content, and more, we train a model to forecast the quality ratings of wines. Building upon this predictive model, we further explore wine characteristics by implementing K-Means clustering combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to categorize wines into distinct groups. This dual approach not only provides insights into the factors influencing wine quality but also offers a nuanced understanding of wine varieties through unsupervised learning techniques. This project serves as a comprehensive guide for wine enthusiasts and data scientists alike, aiming to uncover the hidden patterns that distinguish high-quality wines from the rest.
